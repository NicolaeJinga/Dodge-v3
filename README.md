# Dodge-v3
Recreated old Dodge project in Unity. Written in C# and built for Android. Rebuilt in August 2019 with Unity 2019.3.5f1

## Project Description

You are controlling the yellow fish and with the help of the dpad in the bottom right corner. The goal is to avoid jellyfishes and survive as much as possible for a highscore. Every second a new jellyfish spawns and your score increases by one point. In the bottom left corner, there is a icon for a powerup called Bash, which pushes all jellyfishes away from the player.
